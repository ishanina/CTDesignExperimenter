A contributing factor is the difficulty in assuring self and colleagues that a new design is superior to others across a spectrum of scenarios for patients and their responses to treatments. Innovative designers in academic research centers and pharmaceutical companies use simulation to improve the efficiency and accuracy of drug development. Sophisticated commercial software for CT simulations is available for those with resources to cover fees and with design challenges that happen to match the softwareâ€™s capabilities. Academic researchers usually use locally developed or shared software for study design, mainly due to cost and flexibility considerations. Inspired by the success and immense influence of open- source software development projects, we are building an open-source simulation experiment platform for CTs. We can leverage the power of distributed study design expertise, development talent, and peer review of code, to make clinical trial design innovation far easier. \r\n\r\n###Use cases include:\r\n\r\n* A biostatistician designing a trial ...\r\n *  ... can compare several designs,\r\n *  ... can compare several designs on multiple criteria,\r\n *  ... can test the robustness of a design upon varying assumptions about the patient pool,\r\n *  ... can test the robustness of a design upon varying assumptions abouthow the outcome relates to treatment at an individual basis, \r\n\r\n* A design innovator can...\r\n *  ... port the design to this evaluation platform, or encourage a graduate student to do so,\r\n *  ... make his/her new design easy to evaluate in an unlimited set of contexts,\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nRoger Day (@professorbeautiful)\r\nYuanyuan Wang (@ywangpitt)\r\nDan Normolle\r\nBill Shirey\r\nMichele Morris","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
