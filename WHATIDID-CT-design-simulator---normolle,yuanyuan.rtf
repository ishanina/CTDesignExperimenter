No big deal-- just mistyping (but why did it work before??)\
\
If I add "s", PopModelSpecs, this was set to list(NULL), so it's found.  \
Now the error is:\
\cf4 Error in function (classes, fdef, mtable)  : \

Possibly this is a v8_new signature. popModelSpec="OptionalPopModelSpecifier"\
No!  Old and new versions are the same.\
So, PopModelSpecs = list(NULL)\
was just wrong. Can't be a list.\
\
If I change the arg to  popModelSpec=NULL, the signature likes it.\
Then the error is:\
\cf4 Error in if (TrtAllo > DoseThreshold) ThisPatOutcome <- 1 : \
  argument is of length zero\
\pard\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\pardirnatural
\cf0 This is repeatable.\

\cf5 Error in function (classes, fdef, mtable)  : \

\
So let's return to popModelSpec=NULL. \cf4 TrtAllo > DoseThreshold\cf0 \
\
It seems that this line in generateOutcomes says that you need a PopModelSpec, to set the dose threshold.\
        DoseThreshold <- thisPatCurrentData@BaseChars[DoseThresholdName]\

OK, looking good. Got the PK working nicely as of 4:22 PM 2013-01-30\
\
To do:\
\
Each Scenario in an experiment object needs structure... and documentation!\
\
Convenience methods to save user from needing to understand all that S4 crap.\
\
Parameter constants that change only from scenario to scenario.  Automatic generation of the list of spec objects, across a vector of values for the parameter constants.  E.g.  PK parameters.\
Should not be buried in the spec constructors.\
\
Graphical interface, maybe using Shiny at first.\
----\
\
OK, playing with Shiny.  Easy!  runApp() or runApp(dirname).\
The dir has  server.R and ui.R.  (Or,   www/index.html).\

I cannot build CTDesignExplorerDevel now, though apparently I could before, because I see the file CTDesignExplorer_1.1.tar.gz.  I can't install that either.\
The error is:\
	Error in loadNamespace(package, c(which.lib.loc, lib.loc)) : \
	  in package \'91CTDesignExplorer\'92 classes EvalProbSuccPhase2Specifier, 	Phase2BryantDaySpecifier were specified for export but not defined\
\
Ah, but all of a sudden, I can!!  (Build it, not install it.)\
\
I used FileMerge to add the code sections for EvalProbSuccPhase2Specifier and Phase2BryantDaySpecifier into CTDesignExplorerDevel/R/ExpPlatform_ActionQ_devel.R \
\
I rebuilt CTDesignExplorer_1.1.tar.gz\
On tryig to install, now checkRequirements is missing.  It's been renamed to checkInteroperability, so I modify NAMESPACE accordingly, and rebuild.\
Installation successful.\
To make sure everything is cleaned up, I restart the RStudio project.\

\
I think that doExperiment (and maybe sim1CT) worked before because I had "v7" loaded.\
In v8 and devel, the signature for doExperiment requires an arg called userInput. Without v7 it shouldn't have worked before.\
\
Currently CTDesignExplorer Version 1.0 (same as v8) is installed and running. The code file is ExpPlatform_ActionQ_v8.R .\
The new code is Version 1.1, and its name is CTDesignExplorerDevel and the code is ExpPlatform_ActionQ_devel.R\
\
The new code has a lot of support for prior distributions.\
There is a mystery concerning AlphaPriorSpec and BetaPriorSpec. Apparently these are priors for the intercept and slope in the logit model for dose-toxicity.\
\
2013-02-11\
\
I'm going to begin designing the interface. Starting with 1.0.\
\
The code in the setMethod help file doesn't work.\
Why does setClass("track"...   take so long??? 30 seconds?\
\
The errors are in the help file for setClass.  Do NOT assign the setClass return value. Use new() to create an object.\
Seems to work fine if I rename track to track2.  But not if "track".  I'm restarting.\
Works fine with track2, as I said.\

Now we have BaseCharModel-- but the PopModel I made of 3 BaseChars is not showing up there.  Spelling?\
\
I want the code, RGenFun, to read local slots. Struggling with the method "generateBaseChar" to allow it to do that. If the eval call has only the text arg, it doesn't see the local slots-- which is very strange.  If you add the arg "envir=baseCharModelSpec", then it does--- but then it doesn't find "rnorm"!!\

OK, problem solved.\

\b0 \cf0 \
A parameter defines a model spec. PopSpecs do not have parameters, because they are composite, but the others do.\
A parameter should be a slot.\
\
Each provision has an RGenFun equation.\
(However,  PopSpecs--  get their provisions from the component BaseChars.)\
Aside from PopSpecs, when there are multiple provisions there must be multiple RGenFuns.\
Each provision and each requirement should be a CDE in the future.\
An RGenFun can contain both requirements and parameters.\
\
(Added April 11)\
We should be able to parse the RGenFun.\
Any inputs should be either parameters or requirements.\
Any assignments should be provisions.\
\
Provisions should be slots, because if it uses a RNG, and if it's retrieved more than once, it should be the same value. So the RGenFun is called only one for every instantiation.\
\
\
getRequirements should not be specially written for each class.\
\
CDE repository\
The main purpose is so that one maximizes interoperability by assuring that variables (CDE usages) meaning the same thing (especially of the same data type) can be hooked together between Specs, and that one does not re-invent a CDE \
does not invent a new name for one that exists, or re-use the same name for something different-- generating a spurious interoperability.\

Designing 
\b \ul sim1CT
\b0 \ulnone , the method and the interface:\
\
For simplicity of the interface, we select ONE of each:  PopSpec, OutcomeSpec, DesignSpec.\
This is the current signature:\
	designSpec="DesignSpecifier", popModelSpec="OptionalPopModelSpecifier", 	outcomeModelSpec="OutcomeModelSpecifier"\
showMethods  also reports a version with signature\
	designSpec="CRMSpecifier", popModelSpec="PopModelSpecifier", 		outcomeModelSpec="DoseThresholdModelSpecifier"\
    (inherited from: designSpec="DesignSpecifier", popModelSpec="OptionalPopModelSpecifier", 	outcomeModelSpec="OutcomeModelSpecifier")\
I can't find a definition for this version. OK, it's inherited.\
But there are two other subclasses:\
[1] "APlusBSpecifier"          "CRMSpecifier"             "Phase2BryantDaySpecifier"\
So I don't know why the other 2 don't show up too.\
\
\
2013-02-18\
\
\
I just checked in the first version that show the main panel for "Define one clinical trial".\
\
2013-04-12\
\
New insights on parameters, inputs, outputs etc:\
	We should be able to parse the RGenFun.\
	Any inputs should be either parameters or requirements.\
	Any assignments should be provisions.\
	Instead of RGenFun,\
		every provision should have a provision function or method.\
		They should be chain-able, as with OncoTCap.\
		Extract the inputs from args or introspection.\
		Extract the outputs from the return() line in body().\
	Note that the Outcome objects don't use RGenFun.\
	Stopping rules also have inputs- requirements.\

Each output has a function. the inputs can be:\

"Git resets your working directory to look like the snapshot of the commit that the branch you check out points to. It adds, removes, and modifies files automatically to make sure your working copy is what the branch looked like on your last commit to it."\
"when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit\'92s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together \'97 this is called a "fast forward"."\
"Git automatically identifies the best common-ancestor merge base for branch merging... Git creates a new snapshot that results from this three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it. This is referred to as a merge commit and is special in that it has more than one parent."\

TODO:  Define outcome models as combinations of outcome models, just like population models.\
\
\
2013-06-17\
\
Why is Specifier a ClassUnion instead of a regular class or virtual class?\
Awkward... the code file reads from specific to general.\
\
setClass("Temp1", contains="Specifier")  FAILS\
 setClass("Temp1", contains="OutcomeModelSpecifier") SUCCEEDS\
even though it too is a ClassUnion\
What's the difference?\
\
subClassNames(getClass("Specifier")) --- can't differentiate between direct and all subclasses.\
although getClass("Specifier")  does know.\
\
\
------\
Do we need all those "None"s?\
Replace \
	c("None") 	by 	character(0) \
	("None", 	by	( \
	"None" 	by 	character(0) \
then see if it works.\
\
------\
checkRequirements needs complete rewriting.\
First, requirements and provisions should be extracted from the code.\
(Second thoughts:  doesn't fit well with using CDE's.)\
Second, there should be a simplest method that takes one Specifier and\
a list of Specifiers, and checks that each requirement in the first arg\
is fulfilled by (1) ALL or (2) ANY\
of the ones in the list.\
Then build from there.\
------\
\
A Specifier subclass has metadata. Parameters.  And maybe a shortcut name. And descriptor. And author etc.\
So it can't be a ClassUnion.\
\
-------\
The only use of specifierObjects is as components of an evaluation experiment.\
A Specifier subclass has to be transformed into something suitable for combining into a CT design evaluation experiment.\
* Each parameter can take on one value.\
(Specifier, Parameters, Values) -> specifierObject  (length(parameters) == length(values))\
* Each parameter can take on a short set of values.\
(Specifier, Parameter, Values) -> experimentDimension  (length(parameter) == 1)\
* Each parameter can take on a distribution, as in the Devel version.\
(Specifier, Parameter, Distribution) -> marginalizing over the parameter in the experiment, for example to get expected utilities.\
\
Thus a Specifier parameter is a ClassUnion of:\
	numeric\
	vector\
	distribution\
-------\
\
Experiment designs.\
* Full factorial\
* Central + explore-one-dim-at-a-time\

Sudden warning message about RJSONIO happens when you add shiny to Depends in DESCRIPTION. From web search and my experience, it's not a problem.\
I should write the maintainer.\
\
If I add slots  \
	parameters, requirements, provisions \
to Specifier, now we have an issue.\
Some subclasses have specific parameters. \
They are their own slots.\
How can you handle that?\
Maybe on initialize, you copy values into the parameters slot.\
\
OK, I decided to use that approach.\
To figure out initialize() was difficult.\
This example works:\
\
	setClass("Temp", representation=representation(x="numeric"))\
	setMethod("initialize",\
		signature=signature(.Object="Temp"), \
		function(.Object, ...)\{\
			.Object=callNextMethod(.Object, ...)\
			.Object@x=.Object@x+1;  \
			.Object\})\
	new("Temp", x=1)\
\
I've incorporated that into BaseCharSpecifier\

In building the package, I got "invalid character" or something like that, because there is now the file classTree-explorations.R\
which apparently does not terminate with a complete expression.\
So when I moved files out (into inst/badR), the next one alphabetically then generated the same error.  When I move classTree-explorations.R into inst/badR, these errors go away.\
\
I was getting an error upon run() that turned out to be due to calling\
htmlEscape() with text=character(0).\
The file fixHtmlEscape.R puts a fixed version into the shiny package using copyInNamespace.\
This allows the interface to run. Seems OK. But I still don't know the cause.\
\
The package builds fine OUTSIDE of RStudio,\
but using the Build & Reload button, I get this:\

\f0 \cf0 \cb1 \
(The "undefined slot classes" are because I commented out a couple of setClassUnion lines.)\
\
The cause is unknown.\
I've cleared the GlobalEnv and restarted the project, to no avail.\
The setClassUnion lines run fine in console or in R CMD BUILD.\
\
Yes, but R CMD INSTALL gives the same problem.\
\
There are numerous discussions with similar problems.   Search walkClassGraph.\
https://github.com/hadley/devtools/issues/168\
\
OK, problem solved.\
.Rprofile contained library(CTDesignExplorer)\
and you can't turn off with --vanilla inside RStudio Build&Reload.\
(I used remove.packages(CTDesignExplorer) to discover this.)\
\
Now, we have collating problems.\

Found the source of the htmlEscape error:    an <hr> tag.  Removed the tag.\
This was helpful to debug:\
	sys.calls()\
	POS=7; sys.call(which=-POS); ls(env=sys.frame(-POS))\
\
Upon startup there is an error message that does not interfere with the functionality.\
But good to try to understand:\

getPopulationModelOutputs in PopulationModel.R is in progress. Very important to complete this stuff.\
\
\
2013-08-17\
\
Succeeded in making PopulationModel (VariableNetwork,VN) object and drawing dependency graph.\
Note distinction between requirements and provisions internal to a PM, and external.\
internal it's for interoperability checking and ordering the evaluateOuput calls (and storing the results). Externally it's for fitting with other VNs, OMs, designs, etc.\
There, the only requirements are those not met by the members of the VN.\

Somehow, v_clearanceRate got the dataTypeDetail set to a VariableValue!  logical(0).\
Somehow, adding dataTypeDetail=NULL to the prototype made the problem go away.\
\
\
2013-08-19\
\
In the code for VariableNetwork constructor,\
for(slotName in names(getSlots(x=getClass("VariableNetwork"))) )\
    `@<-`(network, slotName, get(slotName))\
but when debugging, it's reported as \
for (slotName in names(getSlots(x = getClass("VariableNetwork")))) `@<-`(network, \
    "slotName", get(slotName))\
Where did the quotes come from?\
It's OK - bypassed the cute shit.\
