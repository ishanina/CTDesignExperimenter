<p>Innovation in clinical trial (CT) design has had limited penetration into general use. A contributing factor is the difficulty in assuring self and colleagues that a new design is superior to others across a spectrum of scenarios for patients and their responses to treatments. Innovative designers in academic research centers and pharmaceutical companies use simulation to improve the efficiency and accuracy of drug development. Sophisticated commercial software for CT simulations is available for those with resources to cover fees and with design challenges that happen to match the softwareâ€™s capabilities. Academic researchers usually use locally developed or shared software for study design, mainly due to cost and flexibility considerations. Inspired by the success and immense influence of open- source software development projects, we are building an open-source simulation experiment platform for CTs. We can leverage the power of distributed study design expertise, development talent, and peer review of code, to make clinical trial design innovation far easier. </p>
