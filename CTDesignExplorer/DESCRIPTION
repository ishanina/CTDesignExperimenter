Description: This package presents an extendible simulation experiment platform for evaluating
 clinical trial designs. The code base relies on S4 classes and methods. Design, baseline
 characteristic model, population model, outcome model, and evaluation criterion are five key
 object types. An action queue-based approach allows for complex decision making at the patient
 or CT level. The exchange of common data elements provides interoperability among the objects.
